This C++ project focuses on generating investment reports based on initial investment amounts, monthly deposits, annual interest rates, and a set time frame. It addresses the need for users to visualize the impact of their investments both with and without monthly contributions over time.

I did well in structuring the program modularly, separating user input, data processing, and report generation into distinct components. This not only makes the code easier to maintain but also enhances readability.

Improvements could include adding error handling for user inputs to prevent the program from crashing if non-numeric data is entered. Implementing this would make the code more robust and user-friendly.

The most challenging part was ensuring that the financial calculations were accurate, especially when computing compound interest monthly. To overcome this, I referred to online resources to understand the nuances of financial mathematics better.

Skills like modular programming, precise data handling, and creating user-friendly interfaces are highly transferable to other projects or coursework that require data processing and presentation.

The program's maintainability is supported by clear naming conventions and the separation of concerns, while the use of standard libraries like <iomanip> for formatting enhances its adaptability to different financial scenarios.
